# ArtistHarmonyHub: Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the ArtistHarmonyHub application.

## Project Overview 
 In this backend project, I focused on building a server for the ArtistHarmonyHub application. Using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, PostMan, and Eslint. Through this project, I learn how to manage databases, conduct testing, and deploy web applications on remote servers. My main goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
